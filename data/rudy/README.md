This folder contains helper scripts to create test instances based on random
graphs generated by rudy. To create test instances, we need to have a binary of
rudy in this folder.

Then, use the following command from the top of the project.

```
bash data/rudy/create_problem_data.sh
```

To run the subgradient projection method, we need the optimal objective values.
This can be done by

```
python scripts/internal/solve_to_tight_tol.py data/rudy/out
```

which solve all the test instances in `data/rudy/out` and save the optimal
objective values in the same directory.
